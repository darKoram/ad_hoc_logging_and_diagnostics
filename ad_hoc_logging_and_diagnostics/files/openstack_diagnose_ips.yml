# openstack_diagnose_ips.yml

# At the bottom of the playbook you will find a tiny fraction of the requests
# made by Mirantis in the course of diagnosing an issue.
# The requests were to gather logs or execute commands or scripts across multiple
# nodes and gather the results to send to them.

# Note that trailing / on folders is important to rsync.  
# synchronize src=A/B/ dest=C
# gives C/all_files_in_B
# synchronize src=A/B/ dest=C
# gives C/B/all_files_in_B

# Kesten
# We had previously testing private and public assignment of ips and it was working.
# As of about a week ago, we noticed that new vms were not being assigned private ips.

# Mirantis
# Would you please send us outputs of "crm resource status" and "quantum agent-list"? 
# Could you please execute 'ip netns list' on all controllers and send us output?

# Mirantis
# Please send a tarball of the fuel controller's /var/log/remote 
# and the /var/log/{nova,glance,keystone,rabbitmq} as well as
# /var/log/{glance-all.*,keystone-all.*}

# Miranitis
# Would you please run the following commands:
# $: crm resource cleanup p_quantum-dhcp-agent
# $: crm resource start p_quantum-dhcp-agent
# Also would you please send us outputs of "crm resource status", "quantum agent-list" from one of your controller 
# node and "ip netns list" from every controller node after described actions?

# Kesten
# I have automated scripts to push commands and get results to a cluster simultaneously using ansible.
# However, ansible needs to see ips to work over ssh.
# Currently to get to the controllers I have to ssh to root@fuel and then ssh from there to root@node-25 etc.

# Mirantis
# - run following command from masternode
# for i in {31,29,32,28,33}; do ssh node-$i “service nova-api restart; service nova-compute restart”; done
# this command will restart nova api and compute services on the compute nodes
# Also, could you please execute on each controller:
# > $ top
# > $ lsof -n -p $(pid_of_crmd) | wc -l
# and send us output before the meeting? 

# Mirantis
# Here's the launchpad bug related to this:
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1269334
# I'm attaching the file ovs.patch for your review.
# You'll note it's a one-character change to the get_worker_pid() function which appears in four different files. The code that determines the pid in that function should read:
# pid=`pgrep -u ${OCF_RESKEY_user} -fol ${OCF_RESKEY_binary} | grep -E "python\s+\/usr\/bin" | awk '{print $1}'`
# Here's an example of how to APPLY the patch to 3 nodes 10.x.y.{5,6,7}
# #!/bin/bash
# files='/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/mirantis/quantum-agent-*'
# for i in '10.x.y.5' '10.x.y.6' '10.x.y.7'
# do
# scp ovs.patch $i:~/
# ssh $i "patch -p0 < ~/ovs.patch; rm -rf ~/ovs.patch"
# done
